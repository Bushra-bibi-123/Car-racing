                    <h3>
                       Boost Gauge 
                    </h3>

                        Every vehicle has a Boost Gauge in the bottom center which indicates the current boost pressure. 
The dial will raise from zero to full as long as you hold down the accelerator uninterrupted. Releasing the accelerator
 or braking will lose all boost, even in the air.

Once the boost gauge is full, the needle will eventually begin to shake if you have the Tuning Part "Overcharged Turbo" equipped. 
This means that the boost pressure is close to release. Shortly after this, if you do not interrupt your acceleration, the boost
 pressure will release and your Overcharged Turbo will engage, giving you a boost of speed.

After releasing the boost pressure via your Overcharged Turbo, you will need to release the accelerator or brake in order
 to begin charging your turbo boost again. This works unlimited times, but it takes every vehicle a different amount of time 
to charge an overcharged turbo because the engine is revving up at a different rate.

When you charge up the boost with the Super Diesel or the Racing Truck and your needle stops charging the Overcharged Turbo,
 you can quickly click the brake pedal in very small intervals and your Overcharged Turbo will resume charging.

                        Landing Boost can be performed with the "Landing Boost" tuning part equipped by ensuring the vehicle lands from an 
at least 2 Airtime long jump with all its wheels touching the ground simultaneously. Successfully performing this move will be signified by 
a sudden "dash" forward of speed by your vehicle, as well as a discharge of sparks from the wheels and a distinctive sound. If you combine
 it with "Jump Shocks" and activate them at the right moment, it will gives you a boost up and you can speed up your momentum for a longer 
time by perfectly performed jumps
